            <h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
            <p>Starting in 1968, the Soup family were known for making jeans in the small town of Noodleston, Northamptonshire in the English Midlands.
                They were at the very heart of the English denim industry and for four decades Soups’ denim gained a solid reputation as customizble, stylish, sturdy, denim ware.

            <p>
                What started as an invention to upcycle discarded clothing soon became the lastest movement. Worn by celebrities, workers, and everyday men and women,
                these practical pieces were the clothes people not only went to work with but lived their lives in too. 
                But Reconstructed Denim® was more than that. They’re were the climax of a self-epressive movement. 
                They inspired many to do with what they have and create something that not only impacted their lives but influenced others as well.
                Reconstructed Denim® is one of the most well known apparel brands and a global leader in sustainability.
